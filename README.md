**`_Digital Tinkerer (Developer/Filmmaker/Creator/Home Automations)_`**

I'm an indie developer with a core passion for filmmaking. I love to build versions of my own apps to better help any tasks. Whether it's streamlining workflows or crafting tools that provide that extra bit of convenience, I believe every task can benefit from thoughtful innovation. I enjoy the challenge of creating applications that enhance quality of life, even if it takes me hours to perfect the tiniest detail. My goal is to make a difference, one project at a time.
